I am experimenting with libmaple and an i2c driver

9-9-2020

I just finishing running the demo that comes with libmaple
and that uses the MCP4725 i2c DAC chip.

The idea here is to move that demo here and extract just the
i2c driver from libmaple.

This began by copying my i2c demo (which is a copy of my old interrupt demo)
